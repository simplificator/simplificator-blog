You're a professional. Your work is part of who you are. Connect the work with your motivation, and find out what makes you tick. If you can be authentic in your work, do things the right way, you'll get a feeling of achievement, and of being one with your work. This is important because it's the only way to employ the unconscious part of your brain, your intuition. This part helps you be great - if you have to think about every step you do you slow yourself down. If it doesn't feel right, think about it and get the roadblocks away. You know you're doing it right when you truly love what you do.
